      <p>Atavist Books was founded by IAC’s Barry Diller, producer Scott Rudin, publisher Frances Coady, and digital magazine The Atavist. It only lasted a few short years, but was possibly the most ambituous digital book publisher during its lifespan.</p>
      <p>My role as Digital Design and Production Manager was to oversee digital production for our titles. I built custom software and workflows to convert each title from Word doc or InDesign files into JSON to be imported into Creativist (later renamed Atavist). Every book was published on the Creatavist platform for the optimum experience, but was also available as EPUB and Kindle titles for gracefully degraded reading.</p>
      <p>While Chip Kidd was the creative director for most Atavist Books projects, I led the interactive experiences on many of the titles and additional marketing projects.</p>

      <h2>Sleep Donation Trailer</h2>
      <p><i>Sleep Donation</i> was the inaugural Atavist Books title. Written by MacArthur Grant winner Karen Russell, the novella wasn’t an interactive title but promotional materials for the story explored TKTKTK. <i>Sleep Donation</i>’s cover was created by Chip Kidd and illustrated by TK. We had TK produce additional illustrations for the trailer which I animated.</p>

      <h2>Twice Upon a Time</h2>
      <p>Hari Kunzru’s <i>Twice Upon a Time</i> was my favorite Atavist Books title. </p>
      <!-- <p>Author has already written story in a Word doc. I read it and suggested it be broken up into a card-like design. I built a few prototypes to show author and editor. After sign-off, I collaborated with the author to decide on best page breaks. I developed a series of prototypes for both imagery, typography, and sound placement. I worked closely with the editorial staff and author to improve the story cohesion. Author took photographs from his personal collection that I developed into chapter head collages. I built a rudimentary UI within our composition platform so that editorial staff could tweak audio and animation timings while I fixed cross-platform bugs. I also generated an e-book version of the story that was progressively enhanced for each major e-book reading device.</p> -->
