      <h2>Announcing Atavist Books</h2>
      <p>Editor-in-Chief and Business Lead proposed an announcement site for the announcement of our first season of titles. I made a prototype directly in html to show them what I envisioned for the page. After receiving feedback from the main stakeholders in the project I worked closely with our production lead to gather the images and text content needed. I designed the animations and scroll effects, and made the site responsive.</p>

      <h2>Twice Upon a Time</h2>
      <p>Author has already written story in a Word doc. I read it and suggested it be broken up into a card-like design. I built a few prototypes to show author and editor. After sign-off, I collaborated with the author to decide on best page breaks. I developed a series of prototypes for both imagery, typography, and sound placement. I worked closely with the editorial staff and author to improve the story cohesion. Author took photographs from his personal collection that I developed into chapter head collages. I built a rudimentary UI within our composition platform so that editorial staff could tweak audio and animation timings while I fixed cross-platform bugs. I also generated an e-book version of the story that was progressively enhanced for each major e-book reading device.</p>

      <h2>Sleep Donation Trailer</h2>
      <p>Creative Director Chip Kidd had already hired the illustrator to work on the novel cover and asked him to collaborate on the video with us. Chip provided me with a rough idea of his vision for the video teaser (“lots of circles”) and I developed a storyboard based on that. The editor-in-chief provided us with the key phrases from the book to use as teasers. The illustrator used the storyboard to design static illustrations. I animated the static illustrations and set it to sound effects. After showing it to the editor-in-chief we decided to simplify the animation and set it to music which I edited from a stock audio site.</p>
