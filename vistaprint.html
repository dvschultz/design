      <h2>Rebuilding a Print Powerhouse</h2>
      <p>I’m currently a Principal Product Designer at VistaPrint. In my two and a half years I’ve acted as a player/coach across many products. </p>
      
      <p>For 18 months I was the design manager for a small team of 2–3 designers overseeing Order Management, Commerce, and Account domains. In addition to optimizing and modernizing our ecommerce flows, we were also responsible for rebuilding or standing up products from zero to one in a legacy company not always known for reinventing itself. The first half of my time running the team was directing the work of the agency Work &amp; Co. while standing up new projects for my newly hired team to tackle.</p>

      </div>


      <p>I was the lead designer for the complete overhaul of our account creation and sign in process. Tasked with merging the account structures of three very different brands (VistaPrint, VistaCreate, and 99designs by VistaPrint), the project was a global collaboration between product, technology, and marketing from all three teams.</p>

      <p>During my time as a manager I lead the initiatives to simplify a customer’s product reorder experience, stood up the ability for customer to automatically apply their logo and brand colors across thousands of our products, and streamline the add to cart experience for customers. I led deign sprints with our cross functional team to dramatically shorten the learn-build-test cycles for many of our initiatives.</p>

      <h2>Customer and Brand Management</h2>
      <p>In the past year I’ve returned to an IC role, leading through the design and strategy of our Customer and Brand Management domain. This includes expanding our Brand Kit offering and redesigning our most popular account pages.</p>
      <p>We expanded the Brand Kit to include a custom brand shop, where our small business customers can see their brand come to life on a large assortment of products. I also collaborated with our studio team to envision how Brand Kit can be integrated into our design tools to save customers time and money.</p>

      <p>Unlike many traditional ecommerce sites, VistaPrint’s unique customization tools require guiding customers through design tasks normally left for professionals. With this in mind we rethought the account experience to focus on getting customers to discover and complete their next project with ease. This included a dashboard, offering easy access to the most common pages while also inspiring them with personalized products and new ideas to help their business succeed.</p>

      <p>As a senior leader on the team, I also work closely with our PMs, engineering, and data teams to effectively inform the strategy and direction of our work. This can include leading design sprints and vision workshops, or collaborating on OKRs and quantitative experiments.</p>
