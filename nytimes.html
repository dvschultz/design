  <h1>New York Times</h1>

  <p>The New York Times was set to redesign their entire platform stack for the first time in six years. Moving from php to React—and merging our separate desktop and mobile stacks—we redesigned the entire storytelling experience from scratch. Paired with a new cms that offered editorial staff a WYSIWYG-like interface, we transitioned from a strict template system to one that allowed for a wide range of expressions. </p>

  <p>We worked closely with advertising teams to ensure the new article system would support their new ad formats, finding a balance between needed revenue goals and user experience.</p>

  <p>Over two years we have continually iterated on the system through testing and user research. The system has been expanded to include new components, opportunities for desk specific branding elements and translating the design system to off-platform applications like Apple News and Google AMP.</p>

  <p>In addition to the visual design work of the article platform, much of my work involved doing user research eliciting guidance for newsroom and product teams to better understand our users. At the beginning of the project we did a two-month design sprint that interviewed remote and in-person readers. We now run monthly research projects where we interview readers on various topics and probe their reactions to new designs and experiences.</p>
