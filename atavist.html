  <section>
    <p>After the demise of Atavist Books I moved over to the team at Atavist (Yes, it’s confusing. I’m glad I rarely have to explain it these days.). Using my experience of the Atavist CMS I helped onboard new enterprise clients, continued to improve the EPUB export system and CMS documentation, contributed to the CMS component library, and led marketing projects with the growth team.</p>

    <h2>Atavist Homesite</h2>
    <p>My largest project at Atavist was the design and technical implementation of the marketing pages for Atavist to coincide with the launch of their revamped CMS product.</p>
    <p>The multi-page site highlighted the features of the CMS and outlined the various paid plans available to users.</p>

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>The design featured numerous CSS animations and a style adapted from the new Atavist brand designed by the company’s Creative Director. Along with a junior designer, we built the site in a handful of months, moving it from wireframes to working HTML prototypes to its final form as a Wordpress CMS for continued updating by the marketing team. Despite the complex design and animations it was designed to be fully responsive.</p>

    <h2>Additional Projects</h2>
    <p>I was a jack of all trades at Atavist. In addition to the main marketing website, I worked closely with the Atavist marketing team. I produced graphics, email templates, and additional marketing materials.</p>

          <figcaption>Ready, Set, Baby!</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
    <p>I also worked with the new CMS and produced new header and content components to be integrated into the system and used by our community of users.</p>

          <figcaption>Ready, Set, Baby!</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
    <p>Outside of design at Atavist, I managed our variant testing program and other analytics using Mixpanel. I also led documentation for the Atavist CMS, and worked closely with our enterprise clients to help ensure they had a positive experience with the system. I frequently spoke at conferences and classrooms about the state of digital media and hwo Atavist could be a tool in the new media toolset.</p>
