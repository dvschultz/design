  <section>
    <p>After the demise of Atavist Books I moved over to the team at Atavist (Yes, it’s confusing. I’m glad I rarely have to explain it these days.). Using my experience of the Atavist CMS I helped onboard new enterprise clients, continued to improve the EPUB export system, contributed to the CMS component library, and led marketing projects with the growth team.</p>

    <h2>Atavist Homesite</h2>
    <p>My largest project at Atavist was the design and technical implementation of the marketing pages for Atavist to coincide with the launch of their revamped CMS product.</p>
    <!-- <p>Gathered stakeholders to develop initial content structure. Created a series of wireframes to explain content priorities and site structure. Collaborated with junior designer/developer to create initial site designs and got stakeholder feedback. With a junior designer/developer we created a system of html components and a style guide. (She learned sass as a by-product of the development process.)</p>

    <p>We developed static html templates for Wordpress site and then integrated into a custom Wordpress build. I designed a series of animations for the homepage hero, on which the final direction was chosen after discussion with the broader Product design team. Integrated the brand guidelines developed by the Design Director. Continuous a/b testing to constantly evolve the homepage product (in collaboration with our Business Director and various Product staff). </p> -->
