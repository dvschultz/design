      <h2>Empowering the Underdog With Expert Help</h2>
      <p>In 2019 Mailchimp revamped their expert service partner program with the goal of getting 10,000 partners signed up for the program in the next few years. My role was to build out the partner portal and design an end-to-end journey for partners to sign up for the program. The team created an incentive program to help partners level up through the program, and this needed to be reflected in the portal as well as offer insights into their business that only Mailchimp could provide. We designed a system of recommendations that would provide clear next steps to business freelancers and small businesses.</p>
<p>When the program was renamed Mailchimp &amp; Co. and given a unique sub-brand, I worked with our brand design team to explore a look and feel that didn’t deviate from the design system too broadly, but did make our experts feel special and different from the core Mailchimp customer.</p>

      <h2>Extending the Mailchimp Experience</h2>
      <p>A new one-stop shop for any external tools to expand Mailchimp features for its customers, the Marketplace combines 3rd party email templates, apps and integrations, and referral perks for Mailchimp users. As a brand new initiative within the company, my role was to stand up the marketplace with custom email templates and iterate toward diverse category offerings.</p>
      <p>As one of the few product offerings that exist outside the logged-in app the team paid special attention to the end-to-end experience—from entry paths consisting of SEO and ads to the log in and installation path. I extended our in-app design system to work on our dot com offerings, creating a card system that works in multiple locations and spaces. The team also collaborated with the Mailchimp &amp; Co. team to design a single marketplace experience including search, landing pages, and individual item listing pages.</p>
